# Fabricated Parts

3D printed and laser cut parts for EG2310 module.

## Structure
This repository contains all the files that is necessary to 3D print or laser cut to fabricate the parts we used in the module. The parts were constructed to attach senors on to the Turtlebot Burger, a ball storage subsystem and a ball launching susbsystem.

You can go to our [main repository](https://github.com/eg2310g8/r2auto_nav) to obtain more detailed information about our mechanical, electrical and software design.
