# Fabricated Parts

3D printed and laser cut parts for EG2310 module.

## Structure
This repository contains all the files that is necessary to 3D print or laser cut to fabricate the parts we used in the module. The parts were constructed to attach senors on to the Turtlebot Burger, a ball storage subsystem and a ball launching susbsystem.

You can go to our [main repository](https://github.com/eg2310g8/r2auto_nav) to obtain more detailed information about our mechanical, electrical and software design. 

## 3D Printing
[3dprint folder](3dprint) contains STL files. Components are in milimetres.

## Laser Cuttin
[lasercut folder](lasercut) contains DXF files. Base plate, caster ball holder and flywheel cover were laser cut into 3mm arcylic, while funnel lid was laser cut into 2mm acrylic.
